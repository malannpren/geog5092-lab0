# geog5092-lab0
Lab 0 for GEOG 5092, Fall 2020

Completed by Mallory Prentiss

Goal:Learn the basics of Python. Gain an introductory understanding of common Python objects andbasic operators and structures.Become familiar withthe JupyterLabplatform.

Part I:1.Create a list of hypothetical file namesusing a forloop:a)Create a list with the following stringsas elements: 'roads','cities','counties','states'b)Create an empty listand then populateitby concatenating each of the strings above with ‘.txt’. This should result in a list of strings ending in .txt (e.g. ‘roads.txt’, ‘cities.txt’, etc.).2.Write a whileloop that raises the mathematical constant pi (3.14159...) to its powers until the result is greater than10,000 (i.e. pi0, pi1, pi2,...).HINT: You will need to import the math module. Examine the whileloop examples in code_examples/python_basics.py (on Canvas) to figure out howto set up the loopstructure.What condition are you testing?

Optional Challenge: Open the file lab0.txtfrom the data folder and read the lines of the file. Then convert each element into a float type using a list comprehension (i.e. the result will be a list of floating point numbers).
